      <h1>Dehumidifiers for Encapsulated Crawlspaces in Raleigh</h1>
      <p>
        Encapsulated crawlspaces have different humidity control requirements than
        vented spaces. We design and install systems specifically calibrated for
        conditioned, sealed crawlspace environments.

  <!-- CONDITIONED VS VENTED -->

      <h2>Conditioned vs. Vented Crawlspaces</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">An encapsulated crawlspace is a sealed, conditioned space — it behaves more like the interior of your home than an outdoor environment, requiring a different approach to humidity control.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional vented crawlspaces exchange air with the exterior constantly.
        Encapsulated spaces are sealed with a continuous vapor barrier, closed vents,
        and often spray foam insulation on the walls. This eliminates the constant
        influx of exterior humidity — but the space still requires active dehumidification
        to manage residual moisture from soil, concrete, and occupant-generated humidity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference: encapsulated spaces have a significantly lower moisture
        load than vented crawlspaces. Equipment selected for a vented crawlspace
        is typically oversized for an encapsulated one — and an oversized unit
        short-cycles, reducing efficiency and equipment lifespan.

  <!-- REDUCED LOAD -->
  <section class="section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reduced Moisture Load in Sealed Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">A properly encapsulated crawlspace reduces the total moisture load dramatically — allowing for smaller, more efficient equipment that maintains 45–50% RH with lower energy use.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary remaining moisture sources in an encapsulated crawlspace are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Residual evaporation through the vapor barrier (minimized but not zero)</li>
        <li>Moisture from concrete block or poured walls</li>
        <li>Any conditioned air supply introduced to the space</li>
        <li>Minor infiltration at penetrations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These sources are manageable with a properly sized unit. The result is a
        system that cycles on and off to maintain target RH, rather than running
        continuously without reaching it.

  <!-- SIZING -->

      <h2>Right-Sizing for Encapsulated Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Selecting equipment for an encapsulated crawlspace requires accounting for the reduced moisture load — installing an oversized unit creates short-cycling that reduces effectiveness and increases operating costs.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We evaluate each encapsulated space individually. Factors include:
      </p>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Vapor Barrier Quality</h3>
          <p>A 20-mil continuous barrier with taped seams and wrapped piers reduces ground moisture intrusion to a fraction of an unsealed crawlspace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Wall Insulation Type</h3>
          <p>Spray foam on the interior of foundation walls eliminates a major moisture pathway and affects how the space responds to exterior humidity changes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Air Supply</h3>
          <p>Some encapsulated crawlspaces receive a small conditioned air supply from the HVAC system. This changes the moisture balance and equipment requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Drainage</h3>
          <p>Even in encapsulated spaces, a dehumidifier must drain continuously. We route drain lines to the appropriate discharge point for uninterrupted operation.</p>

  <!-- MONITORING -->
  <section class="section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Monitoring Your Encapsulated Crawlspace</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Digital hygrometers placed in your encapsulated crawlspace give you real data on whether your system is maintaining target RH — without guessing or relying on the equipment's built-in display alone.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend verifying RH at the beginning of each cooling season and after
        any significant work is done in the crawlspace. Penetrations for plumbing or
        electrical can introduce small infiltration points that affect performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some homeowners connect monitoring sensors to smart home platforms for
        continuous visibility. We can advise on compatible options based on the
        equipment installed in your space.
