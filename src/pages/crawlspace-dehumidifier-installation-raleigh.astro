  <!-- WHY SIZING MATTERS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why Proper Sizing Matters</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">An undersized dehumidifier runs continuously without ever reaching target RH — wasting energy and providing no real protection for your home.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Equipment selection is based on several factors specific to your crawlspace:
        square footage, current moisture levels, soil conditions, existing vapor barrier
        coverage, and whether the space is conditioned or vented. A unit sized for a
        bedroom closet has no place in a 1,500 sq ft crawlspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use commercial-grade units rated for crawlspace environments — sealed
        housings, low-temperature operation, and built-in drainage pumps or gravity
        drain capability. These are not portable dehumidifiers from a big-box store.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- TARGET RH -->
  <section class="section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Target Relative Humidity: 45–50% RH</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">The EPA and building science professionals recommend maintaining crawlspace Relative Humidity between 45% and 50% to prevent mold growth and wood moisture damage.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Below 45% RH, wood framing can dry excessively in older homes. Above 55% RH,
        mold growth becomes increasingly likely on wood surfaces. The 45–50% range
        represents the safe, stable zone for structural materials and indoor air quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieving this consistently requires properly sized equipment, sealed vents,
        a vapor barrier, and continuous drainage — not just plugging in a unit and
        hoping for the best.

  <!-- STACK EFFECT -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>The Stack Effect Explained</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">The Stack Effect describes how your home acts like a chimney — drawing air from the lowest point (crawlspace) upward through living areas and out through the upper levels.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Warm air naturally rises and escapes through gaps in upper floors, attics, and
        around HVAC penetrations. As it exits, your home draws in replacement air from
        whatever opening is available — most often the crawlspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means crawlspace air quality directly affects indoor air quality. Moisture,
        mold spores, radon, and odors from the crawlspace are continuously pulled into
        the home's living envelope. Controlling crawlspace humidity is not just about
        the crawlspace — it is about the entire home.

      <h2>Equipment We Use</h2>

        <strong class="answer-first">We install commercial-grade crawlspace dehumidifiers built for continuous duty in confined, unfinished spaces — not consumer-grade units repurposed from living areas.</strong>

  <!-- LONG-TERM PROTECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Long-Term Protection for Your Home</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Consistent humidity control protects wood framing, subfloor sheathing, and floor joists from the cumulative moisture damage that leads to costly structural repairs.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wood begins absorbing moisture at RH levels above 70% and can support mold
        growth at surface moisture content above 19%. North Carolina summers routinely
        push untreated crawlspace RH well above those thresholds. A properly installed
        system prevents this cycle entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond structure, controlled crawlspace humidity improves indoor air quality,
        reduces musty odors, and decreases the moisture load on your HVAC system —
        contributing to more consistent home comfort throughout the year.

  <!-- FAQ -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What size dehumidifier do I need for my crawlspace?</h3>
          <p>
            Sizing depends on your crawlspace square footage, current humidity levels,
            soil conditions, and whether a vapor barrier is installed. A typical 1,500
            sq ft crawlspace in North Carolina requires a unit rated for at least 70
            pints per day under crawlspace conditions — different from the same rating
            on a consumer unit tested at room temperature. We assess your specific space
            before recommending equipment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does crawlspace dehumidifier installation take?</h3>
          <p>
            Most installations are completed in a single day. This includes equipment
            mounting, drain line routing, electrical connection, and initial setup
            and calibration. Larger or more complex crawlspaces may require additional time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need encapsulation before installing a dehumidifier?</h3>
          <p>
            Not always — but encapsulation significantly reduces the moisture load on
            the dehumidifier and improves overall system performance. In high-moisture
            crawlspaces, we may recommend sealing the space as part of a complete
            solution. We evaluate each situation individually.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How is the collected water drained?</h3>
          <p>
            Water collected by the dehumidifier is drained continuously via a drain line
            routed to a crawlspace sump, exterior drain, or utility drain — never to a
            bucket. Continuous drainage allows the system to operate without interruption
            and prevents overflow risk.
