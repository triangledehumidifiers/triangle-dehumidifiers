  <!-- WHY HUMIDITY MATTERS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Why Crawlspace Humidity Matters</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">High crawlspace humidity affects the entire home due to the Stack Effect — warm air rising through the home pulls damp crawlspace air upward into your living areas.</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The Stack Effect</h3>
          <p>
            As warm air rises and exits through upper floors and attic, your home draws
            replacement air from the lowest point — the crawlspace. Moisture, mold spores,
            and odors follow that same path directly into your living space.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Musty Odors</h3>
          <p>
            Persistent musty smells inside your home are often a sign of elevated crawlspace
            humidity. Odor-causing compounds travel upward with the Stack Effect, and no
            amount of air freshener addresses the source.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Wood Moisture Concerns</h3>
          <p>
            When wood framing and subfloor materials absorb excess moisture, they expand,
            warp, and become vulnerable to fungal growth. Sustained high RH accelerates
            deterioration that is expensive to repair.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Energy Inefficiency</h3>
          <p>
            A damp crawlspace forces your HVAC system to work harder to condition humid
            air. Proper dehumidification reduces the moisture load on your system and can
            lower energy consumption.

  <!-- OUR APPROACH -->
  <section class="section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Our Approach to Humidity Control</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">We size and install heavy-duty dehumidifiers designed specifically for sealed crawlspaces — not portable consumer units — calibrated for long-term RH control at 45–50%.</strong>
      </p>
      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Proper Sizing</h3>
          <p>
            Equipment is sized based on your crawlspace square footage, current moisture
            levels, and whether the space is sealed or vented. Undersized units run
            constantly and never achieve target RH.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Sealed Vents</h3>
          <p>
            Open crawlspace vents introduce warm, humid exterior air during summer months —
            the opposite of what your crawlspace needs. Sealing vents is a foundational
            step in controlling RH effectively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Continuous Drainage</h3>
          <p>
            Collected water is routed via drain line to a sump or exterior drain — never
            to a bucket. This allows the system to run without interruption and maintain
            consistent RH levels.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            We recommend digital hygrometers to verify your system is maintaining target
            RH. Some units include built-in displays; others can connect to smart home
            monitoring systems.

  <!-- VAPOR BARRIERS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Vapor Barriers and Moisture Migration</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Heavy-duty 12-mil or 20-mil vapor barriers reduce ground moisture intrusion significantly, lowering the total moisture load your dehumidifier must manage.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ground moisture evaporates continuously from exposed soil and saturates crawlspace
        air. A properly installed vapor barrier slows this process dramatically. Key
        installation details include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seams overlapped and taped — no gaps at joints</li>
        <li>Piers and columns fully wrapped with barrier material</li>
        <li>Barrier secured to crawlspace walls at proper height</li>
        <li>20-mil liner used in higher-moisture environments for durability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A vapor barrier alone does not eliminate the need for a dehumidifier in most
        North Carolina crawlspaces — it reduces the load, which allows for proper
        equipment sizing and more efficient operation.
