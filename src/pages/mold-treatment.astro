      <p>
        Surface mold treatment for crawlspace framing and structural materials.
        We correct the moisture source first — then treat existing growth to
        prevent recurrence.

      <h2>Moisture Correction Comes First</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Treating mold without correcting the moisture source is temporary — growth will return as long as relative humidity remains above 60% in the crawlspace.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mold is a symptom of a moisture problem, not the problem itself. In most
        North Carolina crawlspaces, that moisture comes from one or more of the
        following sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ground moisture evaporating through unprotected soil</li>
        <li>Humid exterior air entering through open crawlspace vents</li>
        <li>Plumbing leaks or condensation on cold pipes</li>
        <li>Poor drainage directing surface water toward the foundation</li>
        <li>Inadequate or missing vapor barrier coverage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We identify and address the moisture source as part of every mold treatment
        engagement. Treatment without remediation of the source is not a service
        we recommend or provide independently.

  <!-- CLEANING AND TREATMENT -->

      <h2>Surface Cleaning and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">After moisture is controlled, surface mold on crawlspace framing is treated with EPA-registered antimicrobial solutions applied directly to affected wood surfaces.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our treatment process for surface mold on framing members and sheathing includes:

        <div class="card">
          <h3>HEPA Vacuuming</h3>
          <p>Loose surface mold and debris are removed with HEPA-filtered vacuum equipment before treatment application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Antimicrobial Application</h3>
          <p>EPA-registered treatment products are applied to affected surfaces. We follow manufacturer specifications for dwell time and coverage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Post-Treatment Documentation</h3>
          <p>We document treated areas with photos before and after. This provides a baseline for future inspections and confirms scope of work.</p>

          <h3>Encapsulation Recommendation</h3>
          <p>Where appropriate, we recommend encapsulation and dehumidification following treatment to prevent recurrence.</p>

  <!-- WOOD PRESERVATION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Wood Preservation After Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Surface mold treated at early stages leaves wood structurally intact — the goal of treatment is to halt active growth and prevent the conditions that allowed it to develop.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surface mold (typically appearing as white, gray, or black discoloration on
        wood framing) is different from wood rot, which involves structural degradation
        of the wood fiber itself. Surface mold treated before it penetrates deep into
        the wood grain typically does not compromise structural integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following treatment, maintaining RH at 45–50% creates an environment where
        mold cannot sustain growth on wood surfaces — even if spores are present.
        This is why humidity control and mold treatment go together as a system,
        not as separate, one-time interventions.

  <!-- STRUCTURAL -->
  <section class="section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>When Structural Repair Is Needed</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">When moisture exposure has progressed beyond surface mold to actual wood decay, structural repair or replacement of framing members may be required — a scope beyond mold treatment alone.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Signs that structural assessment may be needed include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft, spongy, or crumbling wood when pressed</li>
        <li>Visible fungal growth with a shelf-like or 3D structure (not flat discoloration)</li>
        <li>Sagging floors above the crawlspace</li>
        <li>Visible separation or cracking along the wood grain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we observe these conditions during evaluation, we will document them and
        recommend that you engage a licensed structural contractor to assess the
        framing before proceeding with any moisture control work.
