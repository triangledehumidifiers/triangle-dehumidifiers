  <!-- WHY ERV MATTERS -->
  <section class="section">

      <h2>Why ERV Installation Matters in This Area</h2>
      <span class="answer-first"
        >In Wake County's humid climate, outdoor air can raise indoor humidity if introduced without
        control.</span
      >
      <p>
        An ERV uses energy recovery technology to exchange air efficiently while moderating
        temperature and moisture — improving indoor air quality without making humidity worse. This
        makes balanced fresh air ventilation in the Triangle region fundamentally different from
        simply opening a window or adding an intake fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        ERVs improve ventilation and energy performance, but because humid outdoor air can still
        raise indoor moisture, they are often paired with whole-home dehumidification systems for
        balanced comfort and humidity control.

            >An ERV provides balanced fresh-air ventilation while transferring heat and moisture
            between incoming and outgoing air — improving indoor air quality without spiking
            humidity.</span
          >
          <p>
            In tight homes, ventilation matters. An ERV helps control stale air, odors, and indoor
            pollutants without the "open a window" approach that can drive humidity to damaging
            levels during North Carolina summers.

            reduce excess indoor humidity as part of a balanced ventilation system.

  <!-- HUMIDITY AND VENTILATION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container" style="max-width:780px;">
      <h2>Humidity and Ventilation in the Triangle Region</h2>
      <span class="answer-first"
        >Fresh air is valuable — until it brings in moisture faster than your systems can remove it.
        We design ventilation with humidity in mind from the start.</span
      >
      <p>
        Uncontrolled outdoor air can raise indoor Relative Humidity (RH) above 60% in humid climates
        without proper design. Ventilation without humidity control creates the exact conditions
        where mold becomes active and comfort suffers. If your crawlspace is also damp, the Stack
        Effect pulls additional moisture upward — compounding the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        ERV installation works best when humidity sources are controlled and indoor RH targets are
        realistic — typically 45–50% for homes in this area.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will an ERV lower humidity?</h3>
          <p>
            It can reduce humidity load compared to straight outside-air ventilation, but it is not
            a dehumidifier. In most Triangle-area homes, dedicated dehumidification is still needed
            alongside an ERV.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does an ERV replace a dehumidifier?</h3>
          <p>
            No. In humid climates like North Carolina, ERVs and dedicated dehumidification often
            work together. An ERV manages fresh air. A dehumidifier controls RH. Both serve
            different functions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need an ERV or an HRV?</h3>
          <p>
            In humid climates, ERVs are generally preferred because they transfer some moisture
            between airstreams. Final choice depends on the home, the HVAC system, and your specific
            goals.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Where does it vent?</h3>
          <p>
            We plan intake and exhaust locations carefully to avoid pulling contaminants and to keep
            airflow balanced across the home.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How often do filters need changing?</h3>
          <p>
            Depends on conditions and usage, but plan on regular filter checks. Easy maintenance
            access is part of every install we do.
