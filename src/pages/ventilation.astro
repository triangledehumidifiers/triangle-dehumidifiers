      <h1>ERV Installation in Raleigh — Fresh Air Ventilation</h1>
      <p>
        Balanced ventilation that brings in fresh air while exchanging heat and moisture.
        Done right, ERVs improve indoor air quality without creating a humidity problem.

      <h2>What an ERV Does</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">An ERV provides balanced fresh-air ventilation while transferring heat and moisture between incoming and outgoing air — improving indoor air quality without spiking humidity.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In tight homes, ventilation matters. An ERV helps control stale air, odors, and
        indoor pollutants without the "open a window" approach that can drive humidity
        to damaging levels during North Carolina summers.

      <h2>When an ERV Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">ERVs are most useful when the home is tight or when indoor air quality issues persist despite other measures.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Newer or tighter homes with poor natural air exchange</li>
        <li>Odors that linger — cooking, pets, musty smells</li>
        <li>Condensation concerns on windows or vents</li>
        <li>Allergy-sensitive households</li>
        <li>Homes adding whole-home dehumidification for stable RH control</li>

      <h2>Humidity and Ventilation in Raleigh</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Fresh air is valuable — until it brings in moisture faster than your systems can remove it. We design ventilation with humidity in mind from the start.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If your crawlspace is damp, the Stack Effect can also pull moisture upward
        into the living area. ERV installation works best when humidity sources are
        controlled and indoor RH targets are realistic — typically 45–50% Relative
        Humidity for Triangle-area homes.

      <h2>How We Install and Commission ERVs</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">We size airflow, plan duct routes, and verify balanced performance — so the ERV actually does what it's supposed to do.</strong>

      <h2>Common Problems We Prevent</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">Most ERV problems come from bad ducting, incorrect sizing, or installing ventilation without enough dehumidification capacity to handle the added moisture load.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unbalanced airflow causing pressure problems in the home</li>
        <li>Pulling air from attic or crawlspace locations (contamination risk)</li>
        <li>Adding ventilation without sufficient dehumidification capacity</li>
        <li>Poor filter access leading to neglected maintenance</li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will an ERV lower humidity?</h3>
          <p>It can reduce humidity load compared to straight outside-air ventilation, but it is not a dehumidifier. In most Triangle-area homes, dedicated dehumidification is still needed alongside an ERV.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need an ERV or an HRV?</h3>
          <p>In humid climates like North Carolina, ERVs are generally preferred because they transfer some moisture between airstreams. Final choice depends on the home, the HVAC system, and your specific goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Where does it vent?</h3>
          <p>We plan intake and exhaust locations carefully to avoid pulling contaminants and to keep airflow balanced across the home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How often do filters need changing?</h3>
          <p>Depends on conditions and usage, but plan on regular filter checks. Easy maintenance access is part of every install we do.</p>
