      <h2>What a Whole-Home Dehumidifier Does</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">A whole-home unit removes moisture from indoor air through dedicated ductwork, keeping humidity consistent across the entire living space.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is different from portable units. Properly installed ducted systems
        control RH without constantly emptying buckets, and they improve comfort
        and indoor air quality when humidity is driving odors, clamminess, or
        dust-mite activity.

      <h2>When Whole-Home Dehumidification Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">It's the right tool when humidity is a house-wide problem — not just a single room problem.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Summer humidity spikes even with A/C running</li>
        <li>Musty odor that spreads through the home</li>
        <li>Condensation on supply vents or windows</li>
        <li>Allergy-sensitive homes needing tighter RH control</li>
        <li>Tighter-envelope homes where ventilation affects humidity balance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Size and Install It</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">We size equipment based on moisture load, home volume, and how the HVAC system actually moves air — not a square footage guess.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We look at the building, the HVAC configuration, and the humidity sources.
        We also verify drainage and safe condensate routing so the system can run
        reliably long-term.

      <h2>Humidity Sources That Make Systems Work Harder</h2>
      <p>
        <strong class="answer-first">If humidity is coming from below, it shows up indoors — especially through the Stack Effect pulling damp crawlspace air upward into living areas.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Warm air rising in the home creates a pressure pull that draws damp air from
        a crawlspace upward through gaps, floor penetrations, and duct leakage. If the
        crawlspace is wet, indoor RH can stay high even with good air conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        When needed, we recommend crawlspace control measures like sealed vents and
        heavy-duty 12-mil or 20-mil vapor barriers to reduce moisture migration at
        the source.

      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Will this replace air conditioning?</h3>
          <p>No. A whole-home dehumidifier controls humidity. Air conditioning controls temperature and removes some moisture, but not always enough in high-humidity conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What RH should I target?</h3>
          <p>For most Triangle-area homes, 45–50% RH is the right target for comfort and moisture control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need a crawlspace fix too?</h3>
          <p>If crawlspace moisture is feeding indoor humidity, yes. A whole-home unit helps, but stopping the source is better long-term. We evaluate both during assessment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How is water drained?</h3>
          <p>We plan a reliable condensate path — gravity drain when possible, with sump and pump options evaluated when needed.</p>
